TPS 1
1:  Static: Global Variable Storage
    Stack: Local Variable Storage
    Heap: Dynamic Storage
2:  a.  3 variables are declared
    b.  2 of them are pointers
        ptr points to an int
        handle points to an int* (pointer to a pointer to an integer)

TPS 2
1.  The program defines a linked list node structure and creates one node on the heap
3.  Members of the node structure are stored sequentially in memory
    The pointer holds the address of the memory location where the node structure is stored
