TPS 1
1.  The expected printing value is 2
2.  The expected printing value is 44434241
4.  four_ints[1] was never modified so it still holds the value of 2
5.  a.  Only 1 array was allocated (four_ints[4])
    b.  Yes, four_ints and four_c are pointing to the same location
6.  The difference between consecutive elements is 4 bytes, or an int
8.  The difference between consecutive elements is 1 byte, or a char
10. A char* pointer moves through memory byte by byte
    An int* pointer moves through memory 4 bytes at a time

TPS 2
1.  This line dynamically allocates memory for a 2D array using a double pointer (int **arr).
2.  We use pointer indexing arr[i]
4.  We need to pass the size as an argument in order to prevent out-of-bounds access
